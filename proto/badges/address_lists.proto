  An AddressList is a list of addresses that are referenced by an ID.
  The list may include only the specified addresses, or it may include all addresses but
  the specified addresses (depending on if allowlist is true (allowlist) or false (blocklist)).
  
  AddressLists are used for defining approvals, as well as being a simplified badge interface.
