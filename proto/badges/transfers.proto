// -useCreatorAddressAsLeaf: If true, then the leaf will be set to the creator address. Used for whitelist trees.
// -maxOneUsePerLeaf: If true, then each leaf can only be used once. If false, then the leaf can be used multiple times.
// This is very important to be set to true if you want to prevent replay attacks.
// -useLeafIndexForDistributionOrder: If true, we will use the leafIndex to determine the order of the distribution of badges.

// Please use unique challenge IDs for different challenges of the same timeline.
// If you update the challenge ID, then the used leaves tracker will reset and start a new tally.

//
// If the first match is disallowed, the transfer is disallowed.
// If the first match is allowed, then we check the rest of the restrictions. If any restrictions fail, then the transfer is disallowed. 
// We do not proceed to the next match.
//
// Challenges defines the challenges that must be met with valid solutions for the transfer to be approved.
//
// requireTo/From(DoesNot)EqualsInitiatedBy defines whether the to/from address must equal the initiatedBy address or not. If it doesn't, then the transfer is disallowed.
//  
// overallApprovals defines the overall approvals for the transfer (i.e. the running tally of the number of transfers and amounts transferred by all addresses).
// perAddressApprovals defines the approvals per unique from, to, and/or initiatedBy address.
// If any of these are nil, we assume unlimited approvals.
//
// IMPORTANT: We track the number of transfers and amounts transferred according to a tracker ID. This is a running tally that increments over time.
// Whenever a transfer is processed that maps to a specific tracker ID, we increment the number of transfers and amounts transferred.
// If the number of transfers or amounts transferred exceeds the corresponding overall or per address approvals, then the transfer is disallowed.
// Note we only track if overallApprovals or to/from/intiiatedByApprovals is not nil.
// If you want to reset the tracker tally, update the tracker ID to a new unique tracker ID.
// Tracker IDs are unique to their timelines. A tracker ID "abc" can be used for the collection, outgoing, and incoming timelines without overlap or overwriting one another.
//
// Ex: If overallApprovals maxNumTransfers = 20 and trackerID = "abc", then the first 20 transfers that map to trackerID = "abc" will be approved. The 21st transfer will be disallowed.
//
// IMPORTANT: Be very careful when updating an approved transfer but keeping the same tracker ID. 
// For example, if you change the corresponding badge IDs and the old badge IDs overlap, then the overlapping badge IDs will already have existing tallies.
//    
// Another common area of confusion is what is actually being tallied. The tally is based on the approved transfer rules that are set.
// For example, if you don't have per address rules set and you update the approved transfer rules to include per address rules, 
// then the tally doesn't retroactively apply the per address rules to the previous transfers. It starts at that time.
//
// Lastly, we have overridesFromApprovedOutgoingTransfers and overridesToApprovedIncomingTransfers.
// If these are set to true, we ignore the from / to user's approved outgoing / incoming transfers, respectively.
// This is useful, for example, for forcefully revoking badges.
// If these are set to false, the transfer must also be approved by the from /to user's approved outgoing / incoming transfers, respectively.
