  // Whether to only check prioritized approvals for the transfer.
  // If true, we will only check the prioritized approvals and fail if none of them match (i.e. do not check any non-prioritized approvals).

## Auto-Scan vs Prioritized Approvals

The transfer approval system operates in two modes to balance efficiency and precision:

### Auto-Scan Mode (Default)

By default, the system automatically scans through available approvals to find a match for the transfer. This mode:

-   **Works with**: Approvals using [Empty Approval Criteria](../examples/empty-approval-criteria.md) (no side effects)
-   **Behavior**: Automatically finds and uses the first matching approval
-   **Use case**: Simple transfers without custom logic or side effects
-   **No versioning required**: The system handles approval selection automatically

### Prioritized Approvals (Required for Side Effects)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Any transfer with side effects or custom approval criteria MUST always be prioritized with proper versioning set. No exceptions.

#### Race Condition Protection

The versioning control ensures that before submitting, the user knows the exact approval they are using:

```typescript
"prioritizedApprovals": [
    {
        "approvalId": "abc123",
        "approvalLevel": "collection",
        "approverAddress": "",
        "version": "2" // Must specify exact version
    }
]
```

#### Example: Coin Transfer Approval

```typescript
// MUST be prioritized - has coin transfer side effects
"prioritizedApprovals": [
    {
        "approvalId": "reward-approval",
        "approvalLevel": "collection",
        "approverAddress": "",
        "version": "1"
    }
],
"onlyCheckPrioritizedCollectionApprovals": true
```

#### Example: Auto-Scan Safe Transfer

```typescript
// Can use auto-scan - no side effects
"prioritizedApprovals": [], // Empty - will auto-scan

// Only will succeed if it finds an approval has empty approval criteria with no custom logic
```

### Control Flags

-   `onlyCheckPrioritizedCollectionApprovals`: If true, only check prioritized approvals
-   `onlyCheckPrioritizedIncomingApprovals`: If true, only check prioritized incoming approvals
-   `onlyCheckPrioritizedOutgoingApprovals`: If true, only check prioritized outgoing approvals

**Setting these to `true` is recommended when using prioritized approvals to ensure deterministic behavior.**

## Transfer Validation Process

Each transfer undergoes a systematic validation process to ensure security and proper authorization:

### Validation Steps

```
PRE. CALCULATE BALANCES (if needed)
  └── If precalculateBalancesFromApproval is specified, we will use the predeterminedBalances from the specified approval to pre-calculate the balances at execution time.

1. BALANCE CHECK
   └── Verify sender has sufficient balances for the transfer including ownership times
   └── FAIL if insufficient balances

2. COLLECTION APPROVAL CHECK
   └── Scan collection-level approvals (prioritized first, then auto-scan) to find a match for the entire transfer
   └── If match found:
       ├── Check approval criteria (merkle proofs, amounts, timing, etc.) and constraints
       ├── Check if it overrides sender approvals (overridesFromOutgoingApprovals)
       ├── Check if it overrides recipient approvals (overridesToIncomingApprovals)
       └── PROCEED with override flags set
   └── Else:
        └── Continue scanning
   └── If some attempted transfer balances have no valid collection approval: FAIL

3. SENDER APPROVAL CHECK (if not overridden)
   └── Check sender's outgoing approvals for this transfer
   └── Verify approval criteria and constraints
   └── FAIL if no valid outgoing approval found

4. RECIPIENT APPROVAL CHECK (if not overridden)
   └── Check each recipient's incoming approvals
   └── Verify approval criteria and constraints
   └── FAIL if any recipient lacks valid incoming approval

5. EXECUTE TRANSFER
   └── Update balances
   └── Execute any approved side effects
   └── Emit transfer events
   └── SUCCESS
```

### Override Behavior

Collection approvals can override user-level approvals:

-   **`overridesFromOutgoingApprovals: true`** - Forcefully skips sender approval check
-   **`overridesToIncomingApprovals: true`** - Forcefully skips recipient approval checks

This allows collection managers to enable transfers that would otherwise be blocked by user settings.

### Failure Points

Transfers fail at the first validation step that doesn't pass:

1. **Insufficient Balances** - Sender doesn't own the tokens
2. **No Collection Approval** - No valid collection-level approval found
3. **Blocked by Sender** - Sender's outgoing approvals reject the transfer
4. **Blocked by Recipient** - Recipient's incoming approvals reject the transfer

### ETH Signature Proofs

ETH Signature Proofs are required when transfers use [ETH Signature Challenges](../concepts/approval-criteria/eth-signature-challenges.md). Each proof contains:

-   **`nonce`**: The unique identifier that was signed
-   **`signature`**: The Ethereum signature of the message `nonce + "-" + creatorAddress`

**Important**: Each signature can only be used once per challenge tracker. The system tracks used signatures to prevent replay attacks.

## Collection ID Auto-Lookup

If you specify `collectionId` as `"0"`, it will automatically lookup the latest collection ID created. This can be used if you are creating a collection and do not know the official collection ID yet but want to perform a multi-message transaction.

## Usage Example

```bash
# CLI command
bitbadgeschaind tx badges transfer-badges '[tx-json]' --from sender-key
```
