# Total Supply

The total circulating supply is not a fixed value but rather dynamically determined through the collection approvals and permissions. The total supply is the sum of all the tokens that have been transferred from the Mint address (which has unlimited balances). Setting the Mint approvals and using them determines the total supply. Permissions are used to control the ability to set, update, or delete the Mint approvals by the manager.
