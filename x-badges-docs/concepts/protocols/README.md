# Protocols

This directory contains documentation for standardized protocols that can be implemented using BitBadges collections. These protocols define specific patterns and requirements for creating interoperable badge collections with well-defined behaviors.

## Available Protocols

-   **[Subscriptions Protocol](./subscriptions-protocol.md)** - Implementation pattern for subscription-based badge collections with recurring payments and time-based ownership

## Protocol Overview

Protocols in BitBadges are standardized implementations that:

-   Define specific collection configuration patterns
-   Establish validation rules for protocol compliance
-   Enable interoperability between different applications
-   Provide predictable behavior for users and developers
