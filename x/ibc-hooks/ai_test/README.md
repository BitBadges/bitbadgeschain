## Security Focus

These tests place special emphasis on:

- Hook override security and validation
- Hook execution order guarantees
- State consistency with override hooks
- Capability handling in hooks
- Channel lifecycle security
- Packet handling security
- Error propagation and handling

## Test Coverage Recommendations

1. **Override Hook Tests**: Test all override hook scenarios
2. **Before/After Hook Tests**: Test before and after hook execution
3. **Hook Order Tests**: Test hook execution order (if multiple hooks)
4. **Error Propagation Tests**: Test error handling and propagation
5. **State Consistency Tests**: Test state consistency with override hooks
6. **Capability Handling Tests**: Test capability handling in hooks
7. **Channel Lifecycle Tests**: Test all channel lifecycle events with hooks
8. **Packet Handling Tests**: Test packet receive/ack/timeout with hooks
9. **Nil Hook Tests**: Test behavior with nil hooks
10. **Panic Handling Tests**: Test behavior when hooks panic

## Status

This test suite is under active development. Tests are being added based on audit findings.
