//TODO: This file should probably be refactored a lot, but it currently works.
//			It is also not user-facing or dev-facing, so I am okay with how it is now

//For permissions, we have many types of permissions that are all very similar to each other
//Here, we abstract all those permissions to a UniversalPermission struct in order to reuse code.
//When casting to a UniversalPermission, we use fake dummy values for the unused values to avoid messing up the logic
//
//This file implements certain logic using UniversalPermissions such as overlaps and getting first match only
//This is used in many places around the codebase

	//Approach: Iterate through each field one by one. Attempt to remove the overlap. We'll call each field by an ID number corresponding to its order
	//					Order doesn't matter as long as all fields are toRemove
	//          For each field N, we have the following the cases:
	//            1. For anything remaining after removal for field N is attempted (i.e. the stuff that does not overlap), we need to add
	//               it to the returned array with (0 to N-1) fields filled with removed values and (N+1 to end) fields filled with the original values
	//
	// 						   We only use the removed values of fields 0 to N - 1 because we already toRemove the other fields (via this step in previous iterations)
	//               and we don't want to double count.
	//							 Ex: [0: {1 to 10}, 1: {1 to 10}, 2: {1 to 10}] and we are removing [0: {1 to 5}, 1: {1 to 5}, 2: {1 to 5}]
	//							  	 Let's say we are on field 1. We would add [0: {1 to 5}, 1: {6 to 10}, 2: {1 to 10}] to the returned array
	//						2. If we have removed anything at all, we need to continue to test field N + 1 (i.e. the next field) for overlap
	//							 This is because we have not yet toRemove the cases for values which overlap with field N and field N + 1
	//					  3. If we have not removed anything, we add the original value as outlined in 1) but we do not need to continue to test field N + 1
	//							 because there are no cases untoRemove now where values overlap with field N and field N + 1 becuase nothing overlaps with N.
	//							 If we do end up with this case, it means we end up with the original values because to overlap, it needs to overlap with all fields
	//
	//							 We optimize step 3) by checking right away if something does not overlap with some field. If it does not overlap with some field,
	//							 we can just add the original values and be done with it. If it does overlap with all fields, we need to execute the algorithm

	//If some field does not overlap, we simply end up with the original values because it is only considered an overlap if all fields overlap.
	//The function would work fine without this but it makes it more efficient and less complicated because it will not get broken down further
