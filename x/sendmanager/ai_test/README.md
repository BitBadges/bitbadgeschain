## Security Focus

These tests place special emphasis on:

-   Prefix collision detection
-   Router registration security
-   Denom routing correctness
-   Edge cases (empty denoms, overlapping prefixes)
-   State consistency
-   Invariant preservation

## Status

This test suite is under active development. Additional tests are being added continuously to achieve comprehensive coverage.
